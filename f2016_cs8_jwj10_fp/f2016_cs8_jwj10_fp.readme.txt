#I copy and pasted your code and I tried to look for the reason why it wouldn't run for me.
#I couldn't find the reason.
#I think it was because I don't have the files on the program.
#I wasn't sure what to do so i Just decided to make my txt. flie anyway.
#Like I said earlier I'm taking this class pass/fail and I had 18 credits.
#I wasn't able to learn the concepts by just listening to the lecture.
#I also wasn't able to dedicate enough time to go through the excercises by myself and learn it.
#So basically I'm just asking you not to give me an F.
#I'll buy you coffee!
