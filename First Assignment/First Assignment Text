The first line asks the user to indicate which measurement system to use
the second line and third lines ask the user to indicate how far and how much gas was used.
the first if statement is for USC
if it is usc then the program will take distance and gas and use the apppropriate units.
then the program will convert the USC into metric system

the same will happen if the user selects metric only the other way around

consumption totals are calculated for both metric and USC
the if statement indicates which order they will be printed in

finally, the consumption rating uses the Consumption in metric to measure the consumption rate
